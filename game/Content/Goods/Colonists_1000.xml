  <Name>Colonists in Stasis Pods</Name>
  <Description>These desperate souls are neatly packed and stacked in their stasis pods for their long journey through space. Because individuals in stasis do not require sustenance, room to move about, or other life support, this is the preferred method of travel for the budget-minded traveler. They are, for all intents and purposes, just another piece of cargo rather than an additional mouth to feed.  This makes stasis travel very affordable. </Description>
