      <DL_Agg>Well I suppose you would want to know about your betters, wouldn't you? Very well. We are beautiful creatures, we Cordrazine. Irresistable, really. </DL_Agg>
      <DL_Hon>Very well. Do PLURAL have the notion of Honor? We certainly do. It means to always respect that which is beautiful, like ourselves. </DL_Hon>
      <DL_Pac>We Cordrazine are a pacifist people. Why fight your enemies when you can just mesmerize them with beauty anyway? </DL_Pac>
      <DL_Ruth>Do you know what it is to be both beautiful and terrible? To have power and grace? This is what it means to be Cordrazine. </DL_Ruth>
      <DL_Cunn>Oh, SING, you know. We're a little bit of this, a little bit of that, but really we're just beautiful, don't you think? </DL_Cunn>
      <DL_Xeno>Well, in truth, we feel a little dirty around the lesser races. You're just so...ugly! We value beauty. </DL_Xeno>
      <DL_Exp>As for what our future holds, we see our empire spread among the stars far and wide. </DL_Exp>
      <DL_Tech>Also, we have research teams working day and night to help us gain and find beauty. </DL_Tech>
      <DL_Mil>But what is beauty without a hard shell? We need to be strong too, and so we emphasize military growth. </DL_Mil>
      <DL_Ind>And so, day and night, we labor to be more beautiful..</DL_Ind>
      <DL_Gen>And yet, while beauty is our highest ideal, we know that a balanced approach to life is most likely to help us find it.</DL_Gen>
