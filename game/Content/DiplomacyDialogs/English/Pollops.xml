      <Friendly>Is it to be storms? Why have you colonized in the TARSYS system, knowing that Pollops have claimed it? Are we not friends? </Friendly>
      <Neutral>A dark and overcast day, SING. You colonized in the TARSYS system knowing well that Pollops were here first. This makes us...sad. </Neutral>

      <Neutral>Darkness where there once was light. Pollops who will never again feel the soils in their roots. This is your doing, and for what?</Neutral>
      <Hostile>On Polmar, when a parasite infects and the wound festers, we cut the sickness out root and stem. You are the sickness, SING. </Hostile>

      <Friendly>Ah, hello, SING. We notice that your warships are blocking our sun. Would you be so kind as to remove them from our territory? </Friendly>
      <Neutral>Your warships gather like stormclouds on the horizon. We Pollops fear storms, which do not discriminate in their mindless wrath. We do not wish hostilities with you, so please remove your ships and abate this coming storm. </Neutral>
      <Hostile>We may seem weak to you, but do not underestimate us! Get your warships out of our space immediately!  </Hostile>

      <DL_Hon>We hail from Polmar, a planet of rich soil and warm suns. There, the jungle is cruel and wild. It is our song of unity and trust that keeps us safe and binds us together. We take our bonds seriously. </DL_Hon>
      <DL_Pac>We hail from Polmar, a wild planet of relentless jungle. We Pollops have had our fill of strife and killing and now desire only to live in peace. </DL_Pac>
      <DL_Cunn>We hail from Polmar, a jungle world that would not at all be to your liking. There the jungle is filled with death for the unwary. Yet the most deadly creatures are the ones that the prey never sees coming. </DL_Cunn>
      <DL_Xeno>We hail from Polmar, where the soil is rich and the suns are warm. Your ways are so alien to us, so bizarre and confusing...</DL_Xeno>
      <DL_Exp>As for our dreams, we wish only to grow in the soils of a thousand thousand worlds and to drink the light of a thousand thousand suns. </DL_Exp>
      <DL_Tech>Evolution, SING. Always getting better, always adapting, always moving forward. These are our ways.</DL_Tech>
      <DL_Ind>We value above all else the relentless industry of nature. To control the growth, though, to build ever more! This is what drives us.</DL_Ind>
