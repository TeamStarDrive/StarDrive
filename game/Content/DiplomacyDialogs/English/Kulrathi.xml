We, the mighty Kulrathi, do greet you, and hope that in time we may find friendship in the Way of battle.  </Friendly>
      <Neutral>In the spring rains / pond and river become one / bloodied by our foes
Heed well our warrior-poets, SING, and anger not the mighty Kulrathi</Neutral>
      <Hostile>You are not worthy of poetry. Stay clear of our systems, animal.</Hostile>

      <DialogType>Greeting</DialogType>
      <Friendly>We greet you, Honorable friend. What is it that you need?</Friendly>
      <Neutral>Greetings, SING. A coincidence that you contact us; I was just meditating on the future of our peoples. What is that you need?</Neutral>
      <Hostile>The craven PLURAL call upon their betters. Speak quickly, as we have little patience for fools.</Hostile>

      <DialogType>Colonized Warning</DialogType>
      <Friendly>Friend, you have settled in TARSYS, which we have previously claimed.  We are happy to share our hunting grounds with an honored friend; however, please respect our borders in the future.  </Friendly>
      <Neutral>I see we are in competition for the TARSYS system. Do not press us, warrior. We will protect our claims. </Neutral>
      <Hostile>Cowardly prey-thing! You dare to settle in the TARSYS system? Relinquish your claim at once!</Hostile>

      <DialogType>Aggression Warning</DialogType>
      <Friendly>Honorable warrior, perhaps your weapons systems malfunctioned in the recent destruction of one of our ships? See that this does not happen again. </Friendly>
      <Neutral>Your unprovoked aggression sends a clear signal, SING.  We do not seek war with you but we will gladly fight a war that is brought to us. </Neutral>
      <Hostile>Insolent cub! How dare you attack a sovereign vessel of the Kulrathi Shogunate?!  </Hostile>
    </DialogLine>
    <DialogLine>
      <DialogType>Warning Ships</DialogType>
      <Friendly>Warrior! To see your warships in our space gives us proof of your courage. Nevertheless, the number of ships and the duration that they have been in our space are causing concern, and you must now withdraw. </Friendly>
      <Neutral>SING, your ships are not welcome in Kulrathi space! You test the patience of our warriors and should withdraw now for your own safety. </Neutral>
      <Hostile>SING, you are either brave or foolish to bring your warships to Kulrathi space. We shall soon test your strength against ours!  </Hostile>
    </DialogLine>
    <DialogLine>
      <DialogType>Warning Ships then Colonized</DialogType>
      <Friendly>You invade our space with your ships, then you colonize in the TARSYS system, knowing well that we have a claim there? Does our friendship mean nothing to you? </Friendly>
      <Neutral>SING, it is only with the greatest discipline that we restrain ourselves from anger at your continual disregard for our borders. Settling in the TARSYS system has pushed us to the brink of war. </Neutral>
      <Hostile>Rrrrraaaaaa!!!! Your fleets continue to intrude into Shogunate territory and you stole our claims in the TARSYS system -- The Kulrathi are no fools!! Relinquish your claims and vacate Kulrathi space or war is sure to come!   </Hostile>

      <DialogType>Warning Colonized then Ships</DialogType>
      <Friendly>SING, are we not friends? Why would a friend first contest our claim in the TARSYS system, and then fill our space with warships? </Friendly>
      <Neutral>SING, it is only with the greatest discipline that we restrain ourselves from anger at your continual disregard for our borders. Settling in the TARSYS system tested our patience. Now you fill our space with your ships. This has pushed us to the brink of war. </Neutral>
      <Hostile>RRrrrraaaaaa!!!! Your fleets are in our space, you steal our claims in the TARSYS system!! The Kulrathi are no fools!!  Relinquish your claims and vacate Kulrathi space or war is sure to come!  </Hostile>

      <DL_Exp>Our destiny is to people to the stars, and woe betide the fool who stands in our way. </DL_Exp>
      <DL_Tech>We believe that a well forged blade is worth a hundred rusted swords. Those who possess the knowledge posses the finest weapons, and it is weapons as much as warriors who win wars.</DL_Tech>
      <DL_Mil>A fleet to span the stars, to drive fear into the hearts of our enemies...to CRUSH enemies! This is our purpose in life.</DL_Mil>
      <DL_Ind>Many among us seek the glory of battle as their purposes in life. But dear to all Kulrathi is the love of industry and the satisfaction of a thing done without flaw, be it a beheading or a work of art. To us, these are one and the same.</DL_Ind>
