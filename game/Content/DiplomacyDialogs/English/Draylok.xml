      <Friendly>Dearest friend. The Council questions your recent expansion into the TARSYS system. I would hate to see our relations strained by our conflicting claims here, wouldn't you? </Friendly>
      <Neutral>My good SING. We notice that you have expanded into Draylok space by colonizing in the TARSYS system. Perhaps you would do well to cede us this colony lest we have any accidents. </Neutral>

      <DL_Agg>What you should know about our people is that we play the game with strength. </DL_Agg>
      <DL_Hon>We Drayloks recognize that life on the galactic stage is a game, and we believe in playing honorably. </DL_Hon>
      <DL_Pac>We know the games that other races play. We played them ourselves for many years, and we have grown weary of the conflict these games bring. </DL_Pac>
      <DL_Ruth>We Draylok play only to win. </DL_Ruth>
      <DL_Xeno>And why would you want to know about us, Hm? So your spies can infiltrate us? So YOU can win the game? </DL_Xeno>
      <DL_Cunn>Life is a game, SING. Not a child's game, of course, but a real one with serious consequences. </DL_Cunn>
      <DL_Exp>It is our destiny to spread among the stars. A thousand suns will never set on the Draylok empire! </DL_Exp>
      <DL_Tech>To us, winning means unlocking the secrets of the universe. This is our highest aim. </DL_Tech>
      <DL_Mil>It is our opinion that the strongest always win, and we aim to be the strongest!</DL_Mil>
      <DL_Ind>We believe that hard work and dedication will deliver us to victory.</DL_Ind>
      <DL_Gen>And to win a serious game one needs a serious and balanced approach.</DL_Gen>
