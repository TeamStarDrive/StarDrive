      <Friendly>In the name of the United Federation, we humans do greet you. It is our hope that we may grow strong and prosperous together.  </Friendly>
      <Neutral>We are the United Federation, and we greet you. Perhaps in time we shall become friends.</Neutral>
      <Hostile>Attention alien vessel - maintain your distance from Human space. The United Federation has little tolerance for territorial disputes. </Hostile>

      <DialogType>Colonized Warning</DialogType>
      <Friendly>Friend, your colonization of the TARSYS system is seen by many in our empire as an act of aggression. Please refrain from colonizing our systems. </Friendly>
      <Neutral>SING, we are not impressed by your recent incursion into Federation space.  I fear your expansionism is harming our relations. </Neutral>
      <Hostile>Attention alien colony in the TARSYS system. Your colony is illegal and will be removed by force unless you cede it to us immediately. </Hostile>

    <DialogLine>
      <DialogType>Aggression Warning</DialogType>
      <Friendly>SING, please check your weapon systems for any errors. It appears that you destroyed one of our vessels and for the sake of our friendship, this needs to never happen again. </Friendly>
      <Neutral>Your illegal attack our sovereignty is intolerable! We are at the brink of war, and I suggest you stay clear of Federation space if you wish to avoid this. </Neutral>
      <Hostile>Attention alien - you have attacked a sovereign vessel of the Federation unprovoked. War is imminent.  </Hostile>

    <DialogLine>
      <DialogType>Warning Ships</DialogType>
      <Friendly>SING, our races are on good terms. Please do not jeapordize our peace by leaving your ships inside our borders. Our people will only tolerate this incursion for so long. </Friendly>
      <Neutral>SING, the incursion of your fleets into Federation space is unacceptable. Please remove all of your ships from our territory before the situation escalates. </Neutral>
      <Hostile>Attention alien vessels -- your incursion into Federation space is seen as an act of war. Remove your ships immediately or we will open fire.  </Hostile>
    </DialogLine>
    <DialogLine>
      <DialogType>Warning Ships then Colonized</DialogType>
      <Friendly>SING, your intrusions into Federation space are growing more bold. We warned you about the trespasses of your fleet and requested that you respect our borders.  Your recent settlement in the TARSYS system, which is inside of our borders, does not bode well for our continued friendship. </Friendly>
      <Neutral>SING, you must take us for fools or weaklings if you believe we cannot see your incursions into our space, or that we will do nothing to protect our claims. TARSYS is our system. Relinquish your claims if you wish to maintain the peace. </Neutral>
      <Hostile>Alien scum! We warned you to stay out of our space, yet you deposited one of your filthy colonies on a planet claimed by the Federation. Remove it now or we shall remove it for you! </Hostile>

    <DialogLine>
      <DialogType>Warning Colonized then Ships</DialogType>
      <Friendly>SING, the Federation council is growing deeply concerned about your fleet's presence in the TARSYS system and elsewhere in Federation space. You should know that this is causing a rift in our relations. </Friendly>
      <Neutral>The Human people have no particular dislike for PLURAL. However, the colonization in TARSYS and the incursion of your fleets in Federation space is causing us to reconsider those notions. </Neutral>
      <Hostile>We are no fools, SING. We see your defiance of our borders and we remember the planet you stole from us in the TARSYS system.  Alien scum!  </Hostile>
