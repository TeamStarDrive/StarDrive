      <Planet>Tor</Planet>
      <SpecialDescription>The Kulrathi homeworld of Rathi Tor displays a curious mix of high technology with rustic simplicity. Its megacities reach into the sky with massive, ornamented towers. Outside of these very vertical cities, however, the land is quite wild. Many massive and dangerous beasts still roam freely in the countryside. The Warrior Castes hunt these beasts for honors and trophies. </SpecialDescription>
