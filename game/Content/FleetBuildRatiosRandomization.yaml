# This will set the Fleet Randomized Ratios for the AI ship build logic. 
#Adds random number from 0 to line value to exising fleet templates
#Example - BuilldRatios[CanBuildFighters] + BuilldRatiosRandomization[CanBuildFighters]
# Fighters: 24 + 0..15
# Bombers: 2 + 0..2
# You should use only the below 5 containers and every one should have the 9 role types.
