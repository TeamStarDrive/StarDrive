    <Text>SING Snacks,

And you have grown up to be so very big and tasty, SING. 

How about you pay us MONEY credits right now, so we could order our meals elsewhere? Or maybe you prefer we take your freighters as morning snacks? What do you say?

Regards,
  Ularmr, A hungey Draug.

Very well, then. This will keep us full for a while. There is nothing better than inter-galactic fast food.

    Bon Apetite

I was hoping you would say that. It is so much more fun to get your food by your own.
