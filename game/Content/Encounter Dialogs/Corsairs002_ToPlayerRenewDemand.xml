    <Text>Dear SING, 

It is time to renew our contract. Would you be so kind to transfer MONEY credits into our galactic account? We promise to restrain our people when it comes to your SING assets,
maybe even help you protect against space monsters.

Regards,
  Captain Martok, Independent Trader and Gentleman

      <Text>What, is this some sort of SING humor? You don't have the credits! Unfortunately for you, this is not my problem. We're gonna collect our money through your freighters!</Text>
