  <!-- Added minimal repair rate for basic Outposts to serve as logistics hubs.
       This ensures 21bn pop Planets with no space port are still able to repair things.
       And the game will send ships for Resupply to these Outposts anyways, so if this is 0,
       ships may get stuck repairing forever at Outposts -->
