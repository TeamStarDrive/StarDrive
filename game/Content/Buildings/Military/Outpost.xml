  <Description>An Outpost building is the humble first step in a civilization's efforts to colonize a new world.  Outposts provide for a base level of agricultural, industrial, and scientific capacity.  When built on a barren planet, it is critical for an outpost to be supplemented with an aeroponic farm. Outposts are also capable of rudimentary self-defense in case of invasion. </Description>
