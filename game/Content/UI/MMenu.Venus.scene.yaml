# This file defines a 3D Scene with objects, lighting, movement and effects
SunPos: [26000, -26000, 32000] # +X:right, -Y:up, +Z:inscreen, sun is at top-right, far distance

AmbientColor: [40,60,110] # dark violet
AmbientIntensity: 0.75
CameraPos: [0, 0, -1000] # Z:-1000 means out of the screen

# You can control group behaviours by adding AI list commands:
#  - [IdlingInDeepSpace, Range[delay] ]
#  - [WarpingIn,         Range[delay] ]
#  - [WarpingOut,        Range[delay] ]
#  - [ForwardCoast,      Range[delay] ] #! object simply moves forward with spawn speed
#  - [CoastWithRotate,   Range[delay], Vec3[rot_per_sec] ] # object rotates around its local axis and moves Forward with spawn speed, the Forward direction changes constantly with rotation
#  - [Orbit,             Range[delay], Vec3[orbit_center], Vec3[move_dir], RandVec3[rot_per_sec] ]  #! moves around orbit center, optionally rotate around obj axis
#  - [GoToState,         delay,  state_idx]  #! goto state_idx after delay seconds

# Supported object types:
# All RoleName's such as "fighter", "corvette", "frigate", "cruiser", "capital", "station", etc..
# Asteroids: "asteroid"
# SpaceJunk: "spacejunk"
