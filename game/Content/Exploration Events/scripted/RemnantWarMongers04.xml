      <TitleText>Remnant Protocols</TitleText>
      <DescriptionText>After gaining some more access to Remnant broken computers, we believe we have uncovered some of their protocols. To our understanding, they like to pit sentient empires at each other and enjoy the show. They have left guardians which triggered the portal creation once enough sentient activity was detected by them. In their search for entertainment, they will engage empires which are not at war with another, preferring stronger empires. If all empires are at war, we believe they will focus on the weakset empire. We think that the destruction of the Remnant portal will end their involvement in this part of the galaxy. It also seems that the portal is absorbing a rather lethal radiation from the stars they orbit and the bad news is that they are getting stronger as the years pass by.</DescriptionText>
