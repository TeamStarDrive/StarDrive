      <TitleText>Remnant Protocols</TitleText>
      <DescriptionText>After gaining some more access to Remnant broken computers, we believe we have uncovered some of their protocols. To our understanding, they believe that all sentient beings are a threat and must be destroyed. They have left guardians which triggered the portal creation once enough sentient activity was detected by them. Their protocols demand and immediate and utter destruction of any sentient life. They will tirelessly continue engaging the weakest empire until it is eradicated and then come for the next one. There is no option of surrender. We think that the destruction of the Remnant portal might end their involvement in this part of the galaxy. it also seems that the portal is absorbing a rather lethal radiation from the stars they orbit and the bad news is that they are getting stronger as the years pass by.</DescriptionText>
