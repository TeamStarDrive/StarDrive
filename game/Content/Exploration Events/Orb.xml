      <TitleText>It's a remnant trap!</TitleText>
      <DescriptionText>As your troops approach the Orb, they notice a control panel. After Some time translating the alien symbols they managed to access the system. The orb was a some kind of very advanced camouflage system. After turning it off, the orb drops to the ground and shatters. The planet scans were greatly changed of the previous ones. It seems like the orb and the planet is a way to lure advanced races. Suddenly a remnant forces jump into orbit, it was a trap after all! Planet scans changed : -0.5 Richness, -0.4 Max Fertility, -4 habitable tiles.</DescriptionText>

Their leader, called Goldymires, has offered to use his connections in order to improve our infrastructure, for a small fee of course. He also gave us his ship as a sign of good faith!
