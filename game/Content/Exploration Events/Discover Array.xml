      <DescriptionText>As your troops enter the mysterious ruins, their scans immediately reveal that this structure is older than any known structure in the galaxy. The building is massive in size and has a single large open space inside. A platform stands suspended over a central shaft leading deep into the planetary core. \n \n The inside walls of the structure are covered in ornate engravings from floor to ceiling. The images depict a humanoid creature standing on the platform as a great energy overtakes him. Over and over this imagery is repeated. \n \n At the far end of this massive hall your troops discover an active energy source - a small device contained within some sort of stasis field. Upon inspection, the device is a sort of quantum data storage unit. It contains the schematics for this building!</DescriptionText>
