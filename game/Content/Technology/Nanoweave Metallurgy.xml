  <LongDescription>Metallurgy techniques are not fundamentally any different today than they were when first implemented in ancient times. Hot metals are mixed and cooled and perhaps run through a refinement process to make them stronger. But with Nanoweave Metallurgy, metal sheets are constructed one molecule at a time by a swarm of nanites. This results in a metal that is absolutely free of imperfections.</LongDescription>
