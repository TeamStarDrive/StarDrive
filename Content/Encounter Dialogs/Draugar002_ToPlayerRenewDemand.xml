    <Text>Dear SING, 

Unfortunately, it is  time to renew our contract. Would you be so kind to transfer MONEY credits into our galactic account? We promise not to feast on SING colonists,
maybe even help you protect against (other) space monsters.

Regards,
  Ularmr, A hungey Draug.

Very well, then. This will keep us full for a while. There is nothing better than inter-galactic fast food.

    Bon Apetite

I was hoping you would say that. It is so much more fun to get your food by your own.
