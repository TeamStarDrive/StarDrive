# StarDrive - MainMenu UI layout
# Created 2018.02.06 by RedFox
#
# You can add or remove elements here while the game is running
# to view changes in real time.
# Some ID-s have hardcoded default behaviours like the buttons
#
Screen: main_menu
  # virtual size sets up the entire screen coordinate system
  # these coordinates will be translated into actual screen coordinates automatically
  # even if the game is running at 2560x1440 or 1280x720, all coordinates in this file
  # are defined by this. Different aspect ratios get automatically repositioned.
  VirtualSize: [1920,1080]
  
Panel: background
  Texture: MMenu/new_background.png # Textures/MainMenu/xxxx.png
  Color: [1.0,1.0,1.0] # default color
  # [x, y, w, h] these are relative coordinates
  # 
  # Examples:
  #   x: 0.5 means axis is at center of parent
  #   w: 1.0 means fill the parent
  #   w: 0.5 means half size 
  #   h: 0.0 means auto-detect height from texture aspect ratio OR set to w if no texture
  #   w: 0 h: 0 means auto-detect width and height from texture size
  # 
  # [0,0,1,1] -- this will aspect fill the entire screen
  Rect: [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]
  # Draw depth controls when the UI element is being drawn:
  # Foreground   -- draw 2D on top of 3D objects -- default value
  # Background   -- draw 2D behind 3D objects
  # ForeAdditive -- Foreground + Additive alpha blend
  # BackAdditive -- Background + Additive alpha blend
  DrawDepth: Background
