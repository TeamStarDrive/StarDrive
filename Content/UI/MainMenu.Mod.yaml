# You can declare Mod specific UI elements
# without having to modify MainMenu.yaml.
# This allows for more flexibility if you do not want
# to completely recreate main menu UI layout.
#
# However, if you want to create a completely different
# and custom MainMenu, just ignore this file and modify
# MainMenu.yaml instead.
