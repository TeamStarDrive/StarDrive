# This file controls FTL Animation parameters
# and can be interactively changed while the game is running

# We use multiple layers for the animations, each one of them
# can have different duration/rotation/direction/scale

FTLLayer:
  Texture: Ships/FTL.xnb
  #Animation: Ship/BSGWarp
  Duration: 0.6 # duration of the warp effect
  Rotation: 5.8 # radians per second
  FrontToBack: True # direction of the FTL animation move
  # animation SCALE curve over time
  # [time, scale]
  # the curve is auto smoothed using a quadratic S-curve approach
  ScaleCurve:
    - [0.0,  0.1]
    - [0.2, 40.0]
    - [0.4,  2.0]
