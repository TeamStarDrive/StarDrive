# This file controls FTL Animation parameters
# and can be interactively changed while the game is running

# We use multiple layers for the animations, each one of them
# can have different duration/rotation/direction/scale

# FTLLayer:
#   Texture: Ships/FTL.xnb
#   Duration: 0.6 # duration of the warp effect
#   Rotation: 5.8 # radians per second
#   FrontToBack: True # direction of the FTL animation move
#   DebugGraphColor: [255,0,0]
#   # SCALE curve over time
#   # [relative_time, scale]
#   # scale curve is auto smoothed using a quadratic S-curve approach
#   ScaleCurve:
