# How to use this repository #

###I just want to play the mod Crunchy!###

* Great!
* go to the download section and download the latest release version. Or latest test version depending on your level of patience.
* backup you original stardrive.exe and stardrive.exe.config. You dont have to do this as you can just go to the steam and reverify steam content for the games.
* extract the zip into the the game directory usually located in Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\StarDrive
* Overwrite files when asked.
* do the same for stardocs required files to unlock some of the mod features for vanilla play.
* remember this mod should be content mod compatible with extra mod power to mods that support this project.

### Yeah thats great but i want to add my own features or change some issue that bugs me###
* even better!!!
* Ill try to describe as best I can how to compile and contribute to this project.
* friend me on steam and request access to the steam SDCodemod forum.

### This is for modifying the StarDrive game for fun and learning###

* Stardrive can be opened up in a variety of .net decompilers which all get the code wrong in different ways. It has to be cleaned up and corrected to work correctly and that is what this repository is.
* Ver. SE 0.1
