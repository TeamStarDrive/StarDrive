# Stardrive BlackBox
This is the 15b version of StarDrive.exe decompiled from CIL and almost completely rewritten by BlackBox - Mars.
The current release is BlackBox - Mars and upcoming version is BlackBox - Hyperion.

Notice: We have StarDrive developer's [publicly and privately stated approval](http://steamcommunity.com/app/252450/discussions/0/385428458177062745/#c365163686048069513) for modifying the game for educational purposes but this software is still under the steam license restrictions.
Do not use this for immoral or personal financial gain, donation requests are ok but can not be demanded or required.
Do not attempt to circumvent game DRM. Be reasonably respectful of the dev and the original software and steam.

# Downloads
Currently downloadable Releases contain Major and Patch versions. Major versions are big, 700-800MB installs. Patches are relatively small and are always cumulative, which means you only need to install the Major version (1.41) and latest patch (1.41-patch).

# BlackBox - Mars
What we achieved in Mars so far:
* Huge performance improvements
* Huge stability improvements - especially got rid of most OutOfMemory errors
* Racial planet preferences
* New mesh, texture and shader loading system

# BlackBox - Hyperion
The future goals of BlackBox - Hyperion are:
* Automatic updater
* New graphics engine - XNA is extremely limiting
* 64-bit engine - will remove a lot of memory limitations
* Gas Giant mining operations
* Asteroid mining operations
* Tradable resources
* Upgraded graphics - a sort of next-gen update would be great
* Steam release - release a remastered version on Steam to reach more players

# How do I get set up for Development?

* Install [Visual Studio 2019/2022 Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/).
    * Workloads Module: `.NET desktop development` with `.NET Framework 4.8 development tools`
    * Workloads Module: `Desktop development with C++` with `MSVC v143`
    * Workloads Module: `Game development with C++` with `Windows 10 SDK`
* Install [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) or some other GIT client. 
    * Configure SourceTree: Tools->Options->Git: [v] Perform submodule actions recursively _(Important!!!)_
* [Clone](https://confluence.atlassian.com/sourcetreekb/clone-a-repository-into-sourcetree-780870050.html) this repository to a local directory, for example: C:/Projects/BlackBox
    * Advanced Options When cloning: [v] Recurse submodules _(Important!!!)_
* Switch to `develop` branch, which is our main branch for latest ongoing development.
* Launch Visual Studio, any required DLL references should be in `BlackBox/game` directory.
* Launch a full build (Build -> Build Solution) in `Release` configuration to produce the BlackBox StarDrive executable.
    * If you get this build error: "Windows 10 SDK is not installed", then you need to go back to Visual Studio installer and enable Desktop development with C++
    * If you get this build error: ".. Cannot open include file: 'corecrt.h': No such file or directory ..", then you are also missing Desktop development with C++

* Install [JetBrains ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/download/) to enjoy enhanced refactoring capabilities.
* Please NOTE: if the **default** Release and Debug configurations *do not work* for you then your setup is incorrect. Contact us in Discord #general-discussion. 

### Contribution Guidelines

* Utilize Discord for chat discussions on ideas and refactoring.
* Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/TeamStarDrive/StarDrive/issues) to propose new ideas. 
* Creating feature branches is always allowed and Pull Requests will be reviewed by the team.
* Comment your code so people can see what you are changing. Non-documented code will not pass review.
* Write clean code, following current best software practices. #DRY #CleanCode

### Who do I talk to?

* In Discord: @RedFox and @Fat_Bastard can provide guidance of this codebase.
* If you have a bug report, post an issue or post a bug in our Discord channel.
* For other feature ideas, you can join our Discord chat and talk with the team!

# Modding
BlackBox - Mars and later have greatly improved modding capabilities and features, 
contact us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/dfvnfH4) for more information on modding.

## What is moddable?
* Globals.yaml provides access to all global game settings, more detailed than previously available.
* All textures can be replaced, PNG and DDS are supported. The old XNB textures are no longer recommended.
* All meshes can be replaced, we support OBJ and FBX meshes.
* Audio can be modded
* Custom stars
* Custom planets
* Some UI layouts can be modded, mostly MainMenu for now
* All YAML files can be modded and are hotloaded while the game is running, so you can do interactive tweaking
* Feel free to ask for more details in [Discord](https://discord.gg/dfvnfH4) 

# Development Cycle
## For new features, refactors, old bug fixes  (feature)
* Create a new branch from develop.
* Always add NEW feature unit tests and playtest your changes.
* Create a pull request and wait for review. Be ready to make a few tweaks! It is easy to create unintentional bugs in this legacy codebase.
## If bugs are found in develop branch (hotfix)
* Create an issue or mark existing issue as a "Blocker" for current release.
* Post the issue in the dev channel of discord. 
* If you can quickly fix it, help us by creating a hotfix pull request.

# Command Line Arguments
BlackBox provides a CLI for running certain utilities from Command Prompt.
Many of these are developer oriented and not very useful for regular users.
