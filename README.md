# How to use this repository #

Ill try to describe as best I can how to compile and contribute to this project.

### This is for modifying the StarDrive game for fun and learning###

* Stardrive can be opened up in a variety of .net decompilers which all get the code wrong in different ways. It has to be cleaned up and corrected to work correctly and that is what this repository is.
* Ver. SE 0.1
